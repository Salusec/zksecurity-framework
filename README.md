# ZK Security Framework
This framework focuses on the completeness, soundness, and zero-knowledge properties of ZKP to meticulously classify existing vulnerabilities and explores multiple categories of vulnerabilities, including completeness issues, soundness problems, information leakage, and non-standardized cryptographic implementations. Furthermore, we propose a set of defense strategies that include a rigorous security audit process and a robust distributed network security ecosystem. This audit strategy employs a divide-and-conquer approach, segmenting the project into different levels, from the application layer to the platform-nature infrastructure layer, using threat modelling, line-by-line audit, and internal cross-review, among other means, aimed at comprehensively identifying vulnerabilities in ZKP circuits, revealing design flaws in ZKP applications, and accurately identifying inaccuracies in the integration process of ZKP primitives.

### ZK Risk Level Description

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Risk level</td>
    <td>Description</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>High Risk</td>
    <td>The issue can lead to substantial financial, reputation, availability, or privacy damage.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Medium Risk</td>
    <td>The issue can lead to moderate financial, reputation, availability, or privacy damage. Or the issue can lead to substantial damage under extreme and unlikely circumstances.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Low Risk</td>
    <td>The issue does not pose an immediate security threat, but may be a lack of following best practices or more easily lead to the future introductions of bugs.</td>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Informational</td>
    <td>Information not relevant to security, but may be helpful for efficiency, costs, etc..</td>
